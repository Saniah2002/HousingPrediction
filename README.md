In our project, we are looking into a dataset from Kagglethat gives us a lot of information on house prices, like how big the houses are, how many bedrooms they have, 
and where they are located. Our main goal is to perform EDA, regression, and classification on the data to understand and predict housing prices better. Crucially, we 
begin our investigation with an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase. This initial step allows us to thoroughly examine the dataset, identifying key patterns, 
outliers, and the underlying distribution of variables. EDA is instrumental in guiding our subsequent analytical choices, ensuring that our regression and classification 
models are both informed and nuanced. With regression, we want to figure out the house prices based on the distinctive features of the houses. With classification, we plan 
to group houses into distinct categories to see what kinds of houses are out there. By doing this, we hope to make it easier for people to buy homes, invest in real estate, 
or make policies to make better decisions. We want to show how house prices can be predicted and what affects them, which could help make the housing market clearer and work 
better for everyone.
